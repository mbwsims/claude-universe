# Drift Patterns

Common types of architectural drift with detection strategies.

## Drift Types

### Utility to Service

**What happened:** A module started as a pure utility (stateless functions, no side effects)
but gradually accumulated state, database calls, or external service dependencies.

**Detection signals:**
- Original version: zero imports from database/ORM/HTTP client libraries
- Current version: imports database, API clients, or state management
- Original exports: pure functions taking input, returning output
- Current exports: functions with side effects, async operations

**Example:** `src/lib/email.ts` started as `formatEmailTemplate(data)` → now includes
`sendEmail()`, `checkDeliveryStatus()`, `retryFailedEmails()` with SMTP client imports.

**Recommendation:** Extract the side-effect functions into a service module. Keep the
utility pure.

### Internal to Public

**What happened:** A module started as internal implementation detail but gained external
consumers over time, making it impossible to refactor without breaking other code.

**Detection signals:**
- Original: zero or few importers (leaf node)
- Current: many importers across different parts of the codebase
- Original: no explicit public API design (just internal helpers)
- Current: other modules depend on specific function signatures

**Example:** `src/lib/helpers.ts` was internal to one service → now imported by 15 files
across 4 directories.

**Recommendation:** Design a proper public API. Move internal helpers back to private scope.
Export only what external consumers actually need.

### Simple to God Module

**What happened:** A focused module became a catch-all that handles too many concerns.
New functionality was added here because "it's related" until the module does everything.

**Detection signals:**
- Original: single clear purpose, few exports (3-5)
- Current: many exports (10+), covering multiple concerns
- Export names span different domains (e.g., a "user" module that also handles auth,
  permissions, notifications, and billing)
- High import count — everything depends on it

**Example:** `src/services/user.ts` started with `createUser`, `getUser`, `updateUser` →
now includes `authenticateUser`, `checkPermissions`, `sendWelcomeEmail`,
`processSubscription`, `generateReport`.

**Recommendation:** Split by concern. Extract each domain into its own module. The god
module becomes a thin orchestrator or is eliminated entirely.

### Handler to Business Logic

**What happened:** A request handler or controller that should only handle HTTP
request/response grew to include business logic, validation, and data access inline.

**Detection signals:**
- Original: thin handler that delegates to services
- Current: handler contains conditionals, calculations, database queries, business rules
- Handler file is much larger than other handlers
- Logic in the handler can't be reused from other entry points (CLI, queue worker, etc.)

**Example:** `src/api/orders/route.ts` started as "parse request, call service, return
response" → now contains discount calculation, inventory checks, fraud detection, and
email notification inline.

**Recommendation:** Extract business logic into a service. Handler should only: parse
request, call service, format response.

### Feature Flag Accumulation

**What happened:** Feature flags were added for gradual rollout but never cleaned up.
The code now has layers of conditional branches for features that are fully shipped.

**Detection signals:**
- Multiple `if (featureFlag.X)` or `if (config.enableY)` checks
- Some flagged features are clearly live (no "off" path in production config)
- Code paths behind flags that haven't changed in months (shipped and forgotten)

**Recommendation:** Audit flags. Remove flags for fully-shipped features. Document which
flags are still active rollouts vs permanently configurable.

## Detection Methodology

### Comparing Original vs Current

1. Find the earliest meaningful commit (skip initial scaffolding/boilerplate)
2. Read the file at that commit: count exports, imports, lines, responsibilities
3. Read the current file: same counts
4. Compare across 4 dimensions:
   - **Size growth:** >3x original size is significant
   - **Export growth:** >2x original exports suggests scope creep
   - **Import growth:** new categories of imports (database, HTTP, etc.) suggest layer drift
   - **Responsibility count:** list distinct concerns in both versions

### Quantifying Drift

| Metric | Minimal | Moderate | Significant |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Size growth | <2x | 2-4x | >4x |
| Export growth | <1.5x | 1.5-3x | >3x |
| New import categories | 0 | 1-2 | 3+ |
| New responsibilities | 0-1 | 2-3 | 4+ |

**Overall drift level:** Take the highest individual rating. One dimension at "significant"
makes the whole module "significant drift."

### When Drift is Acceptable

Not all drift is bad. Drift is acceptable when:
- The domain genuinely grew and the module is the right home for the new functionality
- The original design was too narrow and the expansion is a natural correction
- The module was intentionally designed to be extensible (plugin systems, middleware chains)

Drift is problematic when:
- The module is doing things that belong in other architectural layers
- It's impossible to understand the module's purpose from reading it
- Changes to one concern in the module risk breaking unrelated concerns
- The module can't be tested without mocking half the application
